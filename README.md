### Thought Process
I am always eager to find the most aesthetic way to bring a project to life, so I thought it might be helpful to have a dictionary of different styles of a certain element. For this project, I am gocusing on buttons. Buttons are really interesting to me because of how dynamic they are. From their inactive state, to their hover state, to their active state...it is really fun to watch how they change!
